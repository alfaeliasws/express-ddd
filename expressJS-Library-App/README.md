## Notes
Requirement Notes:
1. DB Using MySQL
2. Framework using Express JS
3. Mostly Implementing DDD
4. Use Case Is Covered

## What I learned in this project:
1. Learning deeper of OOP
2. Learning DDD in express framework and how the thinking of driven design works
3. Learning to work only on Back End Programming, previously work on Full Stack Development
4. Learning to learn something that is outside my expertise (DDD, Swagger, etc) and thriving to understand that

## Personal Notes
Due to religious events (Good Friday/Jumat Agung and Easter/Paskah (Sunday)) this week and the preparation of the celebrations, so until Friday, the project is still lacking things, but all the main operation should be covered
1. The Lack Of This Project Compared To the Requirement: Swagger is still not including all responses
2. Extras of Unit Testing is not implemented but DB TEST and configuration is ready with the case by case situation, trial and  error could use that
3. Testing environment (directory __test__) is complemented by Thunder Client (Postman-like extension in vs code) Collection export to be used as easy
4. Mock data member and book is provided to make the change of json body in Thunder Client easier
